    "My strategy is centered on creating a supportive and safe environment where you feel heard, understood, and valued. Healing is not a one-size-fits-all process, which is why I adapt my therapeutic approach to fit your unique needs and experiences.",
    "I use proven methods like CBT, mindfulness, and supportive talk therapy to help you recognize patterns, strengthen resilience, and find healthier ways to cope with lifeâ€™s challenges.",
